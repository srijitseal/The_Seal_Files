# Small Molecule Bioactivity Benchmarks: Cell Count Baselines

## Overview
This repository contains code and datasets for evaluating small molecule bioactivity benchmarks using baseline models based on cell count features. The study investigates the predictive power of simple cell count features compared to high-dimensional Cell Painting profiles and gene expression data. It provides recommendations for best practices in machine learning applications for phenotypic profiling.

## Key Findings
- Many widely used bioactivity benchmarks are biased towards cytotoxicity and cell proliferation assays, which can be well-predicted using simple cell count features.
- Cell count-based logistic regression models perform comparably to complex machine learning models trained on Cell Painting and gene expression data for a large subset of bioactivity assays.
- Filtering benchmark datasets to focus on protein-target-specific assays reveals the added value of high-content phenotypic data.
- We propose best practices for benchmarking machine learning models for predicting bioactivity, including the importance of baseline cell count models.
- We introduce a curated dataset of protein-target-specific bioactivity assays with corresponding Cell Painting profiles.

## Installation and Requirements
To run the analyses, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn scipy jupyterlab
```

## Usage
### Running Baseline Cell Count Models
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srijitseal/The_Seal_Files.git
   cd The_Seal_Files
   ```
2. Navigate to the relevant dataset directory and run the baseline model script:
   ```bash
   python The_Cell_Count_Files/baseline_model.py
   ```

### Reproducing Published Results
Each dataset directory contains Jupyter notebooks with analysis scripts. To run these:
```bash
jupyter lab
```
Open the relevant notebook and execute the cells step-by-step.

## Recommendations for the Community
1. **Ensure benchmarks do not over-represent cytotoxicity-related assays** to avoid misleading performance evaluations.
2. **Use baseline cell count models** as a reference point for assessing the value of more complex phenotypic profiles.
3. **Validate predictive models using independent test sets** with sufficient compound diversity.
4. **Analyze raw images** to confirm whether predicted bioactivity is driven by meaningful phenotypic changes or merely cytotoxicity.
5. **Incorporate concentration-response data** to improve signal detection in phenotypic assays.
